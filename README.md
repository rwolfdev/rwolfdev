Hello,

my name is Robert Wolf and in my profession as a software developer I work practically with customers and service providers as well as in the planning and development area on complex database structures and software systems.

Especially in the conceptual design of applications I was able to work very successfully on individual problem solutions. Especially the development of database background processes, data logic to support applications (in the web or desktop area) and the development of REST-APIs were under my responsibility.
Through independent, conceptual acting and good teambuilding I was able to achieve innovative development successes.

I use technologies like C# (.NET Framework, .NET Core, ASP.NET, Blazor) and PHP (Laravel) to extend existing projects or create new systems.

Do you have any further questions? Feel free to contact me!
